# Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models
# Generate-On-Graph: Treat LLM as both Agent and KG for Incomplete Knowledge Graph Question Answering

## Problem
Traditional KGQA assumes complete KGs.
Real-world KGs are incomplete.

## Research Question
Can LLMs be combined with incomplete KGs to answer complex questions?
Can LLMs combine internal and external knowledge?

## Solution
Generate-on-graph for IKGQA

Utilises LLMs for QA under incomplete KG (IKGQA), to simulate realistic scenarios
Closer to real-world scenarios where the given KG is incomplete to answer users’ questions
Better evaluate the ability of LLMs to Integrate and external knowledge 

## Innovation 
### Thinking-Searching-Generating framework
(1)Thinking: LLMs decompose the question and determine whether to conduct further searches or generate relevant triples based on current state
(2)Searching: LLMs use pre-defined tools to explore the KGs and filter out irrelevant triples
(3)Generating: LLMs use its internal knowledge and reasoning abilities to generate required new factual triples based on explored subgraph and verify them

## Results
Outperform ToG under incomplete KG

## Weakness
Hallucination
